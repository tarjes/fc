Area-Based Frequency Control in Power Systems

Task description: 
Statnett uses automatic secondary control to ensure a balance between production and consumption. Today this is one PI controller that controls the entire Nordic region. We want the student to design an alternative control structure with several autonomous controllers that interact by means of price and capacity signals.
Statnett works with different models in Matlab / Simulink and want the student to develop these further.
