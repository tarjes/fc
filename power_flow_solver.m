% computations in published research material.
%
% Power-flow solver are extensively used in power
% system analysis. This function provides a basic
% power-flow solver, based on the Gauss-Seidel method.
% The function may solve a power network of arbitrary size
% and complexity. The solution is fast and robust.
% Convergence is guaranteed if the network does have a solution.
% However, this function is limited to the analysis of 
% P-Q buses only (representing either generators or loads).
% P-V buses cannot be modeled. In addition, voltage and current
% limits are ignored. Therefore, this function may be used
% in the analysis of small power networks, or as an instructive
% tool for students, but is probably impractical in real-world
% power networks.
%
% The network is composed of power lines (admittances) and busses.
% busses are indexed 1..N. A power source and/or a shunt admittance
% may be connected to each bus. The direction of power is always defined
% towards the network. Generators are defined with positive
% real power, and loads with negative real power. 
% All buses are considered P-Q buses, with one exception: Bus 1 is always
% the 'slack' bus, represented as voltage source having a preset phase
% (this phase serves as a reference for all other phases). The usual choice
% is E1 = 1.0*exp(j*0), that is, a slack bus with unity voltage and zero phase.
%
% FUNCTION INPUTS:
%
% Ymat - an N*N matrix, defining the admittances of the network.
% (admittance = 1/impedance). All values are complex (representing
% magnitude and angle). Y(i,i) - is the shunt admittance
% of bus i to ground. Y(i,j) - is the admittance connecting 
% bus i to bus j (given i~=j). If no line connects i and j,
% the associated admittance is zero.
% Mark 1: do not get confused: Y=Inf is a 'short'. Y=0 is an open circuit.
% Infinite admittance result in multiple solutions and are forbidden.
% Mark 2: Ymat must be symmetric.
% Mark 3: this is NOT the Y matrix shown in textbooks,
% but a simple definition of the network's admittances.
% minus signs and summations must not be used. Those are
% added automatically in the code. Just enter the simple
% admittances of the network.
%
% Pbus - Active power vector. Pbus(i) is the active
% power injected to bus i. power is positive for generators and
% negative for loads. If no source exists, define Pbus(i)=0. 
% to prevent possible confusion, a power source is not allowed
% on bus 1 (the slack bus).
%
% Qbus - Reactive power vector. Same definitions as Pbus.
%
% E1 - The voltage of the 'slack bus' (bus 1). A usual
% selection is E1=1.0 . This is a scalar.
%
% FUNCTION OUTPUTS:
%
% Ebus - The resulting vector of bus voltages. Complex
% voltage values (magnitude & phase). 
%
% Ibus - The resulting currents' vector (complex values).
% Ibus(i) is the current supplied to the network by the
% source at bus i. For example:  Ibus(1) is the current
% supplied by the slack bus. The injected power can
% be computed by Ebus(i)*conj(Ibus(i)).
% If no power source is present at bus i, Ibus(i) should
% result in 0. Ibus(i) includes the current supplied to
% shunt admittances at bus i. Thus, the shunt admittance
% increases this value.
%
% Imat - an N*N matrix of line currents. Imat(i,j)is the
% current flowing from bus i to bus j. Imat(i,i) is the 
% current in the shunt admittance, not including the current
% supplied by the source at that node. The sum of the i'th
% raw of Imat should equal Ibus(i)
%
% iter - number of iterations done until convergence
